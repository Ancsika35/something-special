<h2> My Dearest Marwan,I just wanted to take a moment to put into words what my heart feels for you every single day. Sometimes, I find it hard to express just how deeply I love you, because it feels like words are never enough. But I want you to know that from the very first moment I met you, my life became brighter. You have this way of making everything around you feel warm and welcoming, and your presence alone brings me so much peace and happiness.The way you carry yourself with such effortless confidence and kindness truly amazes me. Your smile is like sunshine, lighting up even the cloudiest days, and your eyes… I could get lost in them forever. There’s something about the way you look at me that makes me feel like I’m the only person in the world, and I can’t tell you how special that makes me feel.I adore everything about younot just the way you look, which, by the way, is incredibly handsome but also the way you think, the way you speak, and the way you care for the people you love. You have the most genuine heart, and I’m so grateful every day that I get to be the one who gets to experience it up close.When I’m with you, time seems to slow down. All my worries fade away, and everything just feels… right. I’ve never felt more understood, more cherished, or more loved than I do when I’m with you. You’re not just my partner; you’re my best friend, my confidant, and my home.I love you more than I can ever explain, Marwan. I love the way you laugh, the way you speak, and the way you hold me close. I love the way you dream big and the way you make even the simplest moments feel extraordinary. I am so lucky to call you mine, and I promise to never take that for granted.Thank you for being you, for being everything I could ever ask for and so much more. I can’t wait to make more memories with you, to share more laughter, more adventures, and more love. You mean everything to me, and I hope you never forget that.I love you endlessly.</h2>
